      <h2>Basics of Game Programming</h2>
      <p>To get started with game programming, you need to understand concepts like game loops, rendering, input handling, and collision detection.</p>
      <p>HTML5 canvas and WebGL are popular technologies for rendering graphics in web-based games, while frameworks like Phaser and Unity are commonly used for game development.</p>

    <h2>What is Game Development?</h2>
    <p>As the name itself would suggest, the overall process undertaken in the creation of a game is known as game development. Many would think that creating a game is equivalent to mastering a game but this is not true. Yes, while mastering a game does take skill and time, developing a game from a scratch takes a whole lot more than mastering it.</p>
    <h2>What are Game Components?</h2>
    <p>In game development, there are important components that you need to consider if you want it to be a successful game. It will primarily have the ultimate say in the overall quality and potential of the game you have created. Now, what are these components and what role do they play in game development? Let’s take a look at the components one by one.</p>
    <h2>1. Story</h2>
    <p>Stories are what defines the potential of your game when it comes to engaging people and makes it sell more and more. You can either keep the story linear or non-linear structured to create plots in it that could hook the player's interest in a short time. Linear storytelling is the most conventional form of acceptance that has a defined beginning, a defined middle, and a defined ending. In other words, A linear story is like a straight line. However, non-linear storytelling is mostly about creating a feel or setting up a mood in a story devoid of any conventional pattern in it. The recently concluded series “Dark” on Netflix is an excellent example of non-linear storytelling.</p>
    <h2>2. Characters</h2>
    <p>While the story defines the overall potential of your game, it is the characters in it that bring depth to it. Creating interesting and relatable characters with sound background stories is a fundamental method to grabbing a player's attention.</p>
    <p>And while you are working at developing the gaming characters ensure that you pay attention to their looks, personalities, and mannerisms such as how fast they can be and gestures they can make, etc.</p>
    <h2>3. Audio</h2>
    <p>Audio is another important component involved in the process of game development. It works as the backbone of the game you are trying to create. A great background sound can amplify the whole game playing experience irrespective of the quality of the game itself. In fact, a lot of popular games can easily be identified with their background sound or the loading sound itself. You can also use audio to identify the avatars that the players use in the game.</p>
    <h2>4. Art</h2>
    <p>Art is like the overall packaging component of the game development process. It works towards building a feel in the game through various responsive visuals such as the texture, 3D modeling of the characters and objects in the game, game lightning and the weather conditions, etc.</p>
    <h2>5. Lightning</h2>
    <p>Lightning plays an important role in every aspect of your life and gaming is no different. Lightning can be used in the game to overall create a resemblance with the theme of the game such as horror or suspense, etc. It also can be used to create a tempo amongst the players playing the game. Also, the lightning can be used to further solidify the outlook of the designed characters in the game.</p>
